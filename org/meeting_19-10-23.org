* Meeting 23.10.2019
** Compare two papers:
- /EEGNet: a compact convolusional neural network for EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (Lawhern)/
- /Fast and Accurate Multiclass INference for MI-BCIs Using Large Multiscale Temporal and Spectral Features (Hersche)/
- /Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks for EEG Decoding and Visualization (Schirremeister)/
** Goals:
*** Compare the two architectures
*** How much can we reduce precision while still keeping the high acurracy
*** Extend PULP API
** Steps
*** Implement EEGNet with PyTorch (already implemented with on a different backend)
*** Quantize / Reduce precision
*** Implement on Mr. Wolf (first in simulated environment)
*** Implement Hersche-BCI with PyTorch
*** Quantize / Reduce precision
*** Implement on Mr. Wolf (first in simulated environment)
*** Compare EEGNet and Hersche-BCI
** Expertise
*** Xiaying: Mr. Wolf
*** Michael: Hersche-BCI
*** Lukas: Quantization
** Infrastructure
*** Machine to work with
*** Virtual Machine with PULP development environment
** Notes:
*** Mr.Wolf:
**** Has a compute cluster of 8 cores (with only fixed point units)
**** Only two FPUs
*** Quantization:
**** Only partial quantization
*** APIs:
**** PULP-DSP: Library with basic convolutions (1 and 2d)
**** PULP-NN: Library with neural net implementation (optimized for 2d)
**** Must probably be extended for 1D
