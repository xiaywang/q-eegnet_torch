* Meeting 29.10.2019
** Questions
*** EEGNet
**** Dropout Regularization: Read official paper (or online resource "medium")
**** Practices for Quantization (different per layer): No!
** Organization
*** Dates: 16.12.2019 - 23.03.2019
*** Machine: sem19h24@monch1.ethz.ch
*** GitLab account for repo
** Storage:
Use home for code and results, use scratch for training data and environment
** Next Steps:
*** Read /Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks for EEG Decoding and Visualization (Schirremeister)/
*** Start implementing EEGNet on PyTorch, then have the next meeting
** Important for grading
*** Effort / Independence
*** Prepare meeting (quick presentation)
*** Teamwork (communication)
*** Result / Methodology
*** Presentation is important for the general impressions
*** Prokect Plan!
** Notes
*** Check Dimensionality (and ordering)
*** Possibility: Move start point of the recorded data by 1 sample and treat as independent. (Called Crops in the Paper)
This approach may not be particularly good for this case.
